                                        GoMeat IT Solutions (Pvt) Ltd and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“GoFeast,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) own and operate certain websites (including gofeast.pk, orders.gofeast.pk), certain technology platforms, and certain other related online and mobile services (including, without limitation, our Mobile Applications, as defined below) that reference or will reference these Terms of Use (collectively, the “Sites”).

                                        ABOUT GoFeast

                                        GoFeast connects consumers with local Restaurants and stores. You may order cooked food or grocery or meat through the Sites to be delivered from any provider vendor where GoFeast offers such services. GoFeast is not a store/restaurant or food preparation entity. The stores and partners places available on our Sites (collectively, the “stores/restaurants”) operate independently of GoFeast. The partner restaurants/stores are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and marketing of grocery, meal and meat, including, without limitation, preparation and safety and menu disclosure. GoFeast is not liable or responsible for the stores food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, GoFeast does not guarantee the quality of what the restaurants/Stores or other food purveyors sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or engage another third party delivery service. GoFeast does not independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by stores regarding their items, including, without limitation, any menu- or store-level descriptors or disclosures. Some deliveries are provided by GoFeast's network of independent delivery partners (“DPs”). DPs have entered into agreements with GoFeast, which require them to comply with all applicable federal, provincial, and local laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, traffic laws, and applicable insurance requirements. GoFeast shall not be liable or responsible for any delivery services partner by DSPs or any subcontractors of DSPs, or any errors or misrepresentations made by any of them.

                                        USING GoFeast

                                        You may only create and hold one account on each Site for your personal use (an “Account”). In consideration of the use of the Sites and the services contained therein, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with GoFeast, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

                                        The Sites may permit you to make purchases without an Account or without logging in to your Account. If you make a purchase in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Sites if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization.

                                        If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if GoFeast has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, GoFeast has the right to block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits or promotional offers and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you.

                                        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third-party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify GoFeast of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. GoFeast will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password.

                                        PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY

                                        Certain features of the Sites, including, without limitation, the placing of orders, may require you to make certain payments. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by GoFeast. GoFeast, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.

                                        GoFeast will charge, and you authorize GoFeast to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any amounts with a credit card, GoFeast may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event GoFeast advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Sites (e.g., if you sign up for a corporate account), GoFeast may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant GoFeast the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.

                                        GoFeast reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, and/or surcharges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the services at any time. GoFeast may also, in its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different features and different rates to any or all of our customers. Unless made to you, these promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged.

Further, if you provide any suggestions, input, or other feedback relating to the Sites or the services we provide (collectively, the “Feedback”), GoFeast shall have the right to freely and fully exercise and exploit the Feedback in connection with our business or the business of our partners or affiliates, without notice to, approval by, or compensation to you. Accordingly, you hereby grant GoFeast a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, nonexclusive license to all rights necessary to incorporate and use the Feedback for any purpose.

We expect your cooperation in upholding our standards. You are responsible for all of your User Content. You agree not to provide any User Content that:

                                        ● is unlawful, harmful to adults or minors, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, offensive, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, and/or racially, ethnically, and/or otherwise objectionable; has a commercial, political, or religious purpose;

                                        ● is false, misleading, and/or not written in good faith;

                                        ● infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy and/or publicity, and/or other proprietary rights of any person and/or entity;

                                        ● contains unauthorized advertising and/or solicits users to a business other than those on the Sites; and/or

                                        ● is intended to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality or integrity of any computer software, hardware, or Materials on the Sites or other websites.

                                        We do our best to encourage civility and discourage disruptive communication on the Sites. We also do our best to discourage communications that incite others to violate our standards. GoFeast may monitor any and all use of the Sites, including, without limitation, interactions between our users; however, we are under no obligation to do so. We may manage the Sites in a manner intended to protect our property and rights and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Sites. If any User Content or conduct on our Sites violates our standards, or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement; or interferes with other peoples' enjoyment of the Materials or our Sites; or is inappropriate in our judgment; we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, delete or remove, in part or in full, any such User Content or Materials, and we further reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to any Interactive Areas or any Sites. GoFeast will cooperate with local, state, and/or federal authorities to the extent required by applicable law in connection with User Content.

                                        V. Ratings and Reviews

                                        The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (“Ratings”) and post reviews (“Reviews”) of Stores and other businesses. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by GoFeast, and do not represent the views of GoFeast or of any affiliate or partner of GoFeast. GoFeast does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities, or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content.

Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed or excluded by us without notice.

                                        COMMUNICATIONS & TEXT MESSAGES

                                        By voluntarily providing your cell phone number to GoFeast, you agree that GoFeast may contact you by telephone, SMS, or MMS messages at that phone number, and you hereby consent to receiving such communications for transactional, operational, or informational purposes. You understand that such messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. You may unsubscribe from receiving text messages from GoFeast at any time.

                                        ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS

                                        We may make available software to access GoFeast’s websites, technology platforms, and related online and mobile services via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile Application, you must use a mobile device that is compatible with that Mobile Application. GoFeast does not warrant that any Mobile Application will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Applications and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. GoFeast hereby grants you a non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications for one Account on a mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You acknowledge that GoFeast may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Applications, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of any Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device and agree to timely upgrade the Mobile Application in the event there is no automatic update. You further agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all upgrades to the Mobile Applications. Any third party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof, and GoFeast or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void.

                                        GOVERNING LAW

                                        You acknowledge and agree that your access to and/or use of the Sites, the Materials, and other content on the Sites is subject to all applicable international, federal, Provincial, and local laws and regulations.

                                        DISPUTE RESOLUTION

                                        I. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

                                        You agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials, and/or other content on the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

You further acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and GoFeast otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if GoFeast changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Sites after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing GoFeast written notice of such rejection by mail or hand deliver,or by email from the email address associated with your account to: info@gofeast.pk, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above.

                                        WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY

                                        Any waiver by GoFeast of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing. If any portion of this Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible except that in the event of unenforceability of the class action waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. The remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to terms contained herein.

                                        ENTIRE AGREEMENT

                                        This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with GoFeast in connection with the Sites and the services hereunder, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and GoFeast concerning the Sites and the services hereunder.
