With only ~1.5 million GOMT in circulation at the moment, an elaborate burn mechanism and excellent value proposition, GOMT is bound to increase in value. GOMT had its debut listing on BitMart and is now available for trading (13 May 2022, 5:00 AM EDT). GOMT listed at an opening price of <strong>$0.90</strong> with USDT/GOMT trading pair and a liquidity pool of <strong>50k USDT | 55555 GOMT</strong>. To promote the listing event, GoFeast will be carrying out multiple trading competitions and launch a staking program etc. All updates on the upcoming events will be shared through GoFeast Twitter and Telegram Channel
As a result of the new listing and other opportunities that are coming our way, we believe GOMTs potential has reached a new level.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The growing global specialty food industry has led to a high demand for specialty certification services by third party certification authorities. High demand for certification services in combination with a decentralized form of accreditation by Specialty Board and inability to support the specialty industry efficiently has shown cracks in the conventional specialty certification model, which has become costly, inefficient, fraudulent and risky. GoFeast phase 3 will introduce the following features:</p>
                        
                        <ul>

                                Digital specialty meat certifications, integration with specialty certification authorities to create blockchain based smart contracts to validate certification validity for the stores. The smart contract validated certificates will be available inside the apps under each store for the customers to view.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Customers will receive full transparency about a store’s certification status 
                            </li>

                                Every step of the specialty meat supply chain will be tracked and documented on blockchain to provide full transparency and visibility about the animal’s origin, living conditions, health and slaughtering method.

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">GoFeast is a marketplace leveraging blockchain technology, connecting consumers with specialty retail meat stores that primarily offer fresh Halal and Kosher meat products such as red meat, poultry and seafood. Specialty meat is not available in traditional grocery stores in the US and other Western countries. It is only available in certified specialty retail stores. There are more than 10,000 halal meat stores in North America alone. Currently, the global halal and kosher market is estimated at over $1.8 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $2.2 trillion by 2024. The halal food market in the US alone is estimated at over $32 Billion and is showing an aggressive annual growth. Over 90% of existing Halal and Kosher stores do not have an online presence, GoFeast extends their presence online by including options for electronic payments in usual fiat currencies. In addition, it will also provide small-scale store owners with the mechanism and tools to deliver their meat products to consumer’s doorsteps.
