                        <p>GoFeast bridges the gap between specialty retailers and consumers using a smartphone app to order halal meats from local suppliers.</p>
                        <p>Although it would be easy to increase fees during the pandemic, the GoFeast policy remains firm. During the COVID-19 lockdown, this thriving business has gained huge traction. The GoFeast order volume over the past 45 days has already matched last year’s sales figures.</p>

                          <p>It is times like these that differentiate community-focused businesses from their competitors in any industry. Although we have the only halal meat delivery service app, it is our utmost priority to maintain affordability for all our customers.”</p>
