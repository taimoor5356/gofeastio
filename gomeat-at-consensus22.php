                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Consensus by CoinDesk has been a successful Crypto-focussed event for many years. Since 2015, Consensus has been recognized as the most influential event in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Attended by a large number of people, Consensus2018 and 2019 were unforgettable. </p>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">This year, after a long lockdown, Consensus returned to an in-person format as 20,000 attendees descended on Austin, Texas. The groundbreaking 3-day festival brought together thousands of crypto-enthusiasts to hear from the most sought-after thought leaders and experience a wide range of keynotes, exclusive panels, workshops, and networking opportunities. The festival-style event was held June 10th - 12th, 2022, with the Austin Convention Center as its hub, while other locations throughout the city hosted a variety of additional programming from CoinDesk, the World Economic Forum, Coin Center, and other partner organizations.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the only festival showcasing and celebrating all sides of the blockchain, crypto ecosystems, Web3, and the metaverse, and their wide-reaching effect on commerce, culture, and communities. At Consensus, over 400 of the brightest minds in the crypto world spoke, including Kimbal Musk, Changpeng Zhao, and Garry Kasparov, among others.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">GoFeast was also among blockchain focused projects participating in the event and was able to generate a significant amount of buzz because it is one of the only few blockchain companies with a real-life everyday use case, currently generating revenue. In addition to the large crowd and enthusiastic participants, we were also successful in attracting a large number of venture capitalists, investment fund managers, and institutions. Some of the largest exchanges in the world that were present at the event expressed their excitement with both the concept of GOMT, it's tokenomics, as well as its utility offerings.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">GoFeast attracted a large number of attendees to its booth, carrying out interactive activities such as raffle draw giveaway and was able to introduce the project to potential customers and investors. With a beyond exceptional response at Consensus22, GoFeast wrapped up their booth on 12 June, 2022, having made many valuable connections. It was an amazing opportunity to engage in thought-provoking dialogues, participate in heated debates, and take part in one-of-a-kind experiences learning about new technologies and communities, transforming the worlds of financial investment and marketing. All in all, GoFeast has solidified its concept and space in the blockchain arena for a long time to come.</p>
