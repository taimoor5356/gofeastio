                                    The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (“Ratings”) and post reviews
                                    (“Reviews”) of Stores and other businesses. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User
                                    Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without
                                    limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of
                                    conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by GoFeast, and do not represent the views of
                                    GoFeast or of any affiliate or partner of GoFeast. GoFeast does not assume liability for Ratings
                                    and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities, or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We
                                    strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content.
                                    Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the following criteria: <br>(1) before posting a
                                    Rating or Review, you must have had first-hand experience with the Store within the 7-day period
                                    prior to your review; <br>(2) you may not have a proprietary or other affiliation with either the Store or
                                    any of its competitors; <br>(3) you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the Stores'
                                    products, services, or conduct; <br>and <br>(4) your review must otherwise comply with the terms of this
                                    Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish
                                    the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed or
                                    excluded by us without notice.

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                            We may make available software to access GoFeast’s websites, technology platforms, and
                            related online and mobile services via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile
                            Application, you must use a mobile device that is compatible with that Mobile Application.
                            GoFeast does not warrant that any Mobile Application will be compatible with your mobile device.
                            You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Applications and may incur additional
                            charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible
                            for any such charges. GoFeast hereby grants you a non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable
                            license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications for one Account on a mobile
                            device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You acknowledge that GoFeast may
                            from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Applications, and may automatically
                            electronically upgrade the version of any Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile
                            device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device and agree to timely
                            upgrade the Mobile Application in the event there is no automatic update. You further agree that
                            the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all upgrades to the Mobile Applications.
                            Any third party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the
                            applicable open source or third party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The
                            foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof, and GoFeast
                            or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications
                            (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties, or obligations
                            hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. GoFeast reserves all
                            rights not expressly granted under this Agreement with respect to the Mobile Applications and
                            otherwise. If any Mobile Application is being acquired on behalf of the United States
                            Government, then the following provision applies: The Mobile Application will be deemed to be
                            “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,”
                            respectively, pursuant to DFAR § 227.7202 and FAR § 12.212, as applicable. Any use,

                            documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by this Agreement and is
                            prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement. The Mobile Applications
                            originate in the United States and are subject to United States export laws and regulations. The
                            Mobile Applications may not be exported or reexported to certain countries or those persons or
                            entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile
                            Applications may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to
                            comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Applications and the
                            Sites.

                            you and GoFeast, not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) and that Apple has no responsibility for the

                            comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation

                            Software. In the event of any failure of the Apple-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable
                            warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund to you the purchase price for the

                            other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software, and any other
                            claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to
                            any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to GoFeast as
                            provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any of
                            your claims or those of any third party relating to the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession
                            and/or use of the Apple-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims;
                            (ii) any claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or

                            and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to GoFeast as
                            provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the
                            Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes
                            that third party’s intellectual property rights, GoFeast, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
                            investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement
                            claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and GoFeast acknowledge and agree that
                            Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as it relates to
                            your license of the Apple-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and
                            conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
                            right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary as it relates to your
                            license of the Apple-Sourced Software .

                            GoFeast only, and not with Google, Inc. (“Google”); <br>(ii) your use of Google-Sourced Software
                            must comply with Google’s then-current Google Play Store Terms of Service; <br>(iii) Google is only

                            GoFeast, and not Google, is solely responsible for its Google-Sourced Software; <br>(v) Google has
                            no obligation or liability to you with respect to Google-Sourced Software or the Agreement; and

                                    or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks,
                                    trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Arbitration means that an arbitrator
                                    and not a judge or jury will decide the claim. Rights to prehearing exchange of information and
                                    appeals may also be limited in arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and GoFeast are

                                    proceeding. Further, unless both you and GoFeast otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may
                                    not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
                                    any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
                                    entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the

                                    party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
                                    the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by the claimant's
                                    individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and

                                    Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set
                                    forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000, GoFeast
                                    will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
                                    relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose
                                    (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                                    not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the
                                    provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if GoFeast changes this "Dispute

                                    you may reject any such change by providing GoFeast written notice of such rejection by mail or

                                    "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly

                            Any waiver by GoFeast of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing. If any portion of this
                            Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be
                            deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original
                            provision as closely as possible except that in the event of unenforceability of the class action
                            waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. The remainder of this Agreement
                            shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to terms contained herein.
