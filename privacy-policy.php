                                party operating any site to which the Sites contain a link. For clarity, the inclusion of a link to a
                                third-party website on the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our

                                with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. We may limit the availability of the Sites, in whole

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">If you are a user of the Sites and a California resident, California's "Shine the Light" law
                                (California Civil Code §1798.83) permits you to request and obtain from us once a year, free of

                                for direct marketing purposes. If this law applies to you and you would like to make such a
