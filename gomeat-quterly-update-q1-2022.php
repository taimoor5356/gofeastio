                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Despite recent volatile swings in crypto economy, we have stayed focused in execution of our strategy. As always, keeping our promise with our community to stay transparent, we have following areas to report in this quarterly update: </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">GoFeast Business Expansion:</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Our primary focus has remained on business fundamentals and execution of our growth strategy. With tremendous efforts being put in short time by our amazing team, our customer base has increased and is nearing <strong>5,000</strong> total customers with Specialty meat now more accessible than ever before. We have added about <strong>400</strong> new stores in <strong>Q1</strong> only and with <strong>900+</strong> total operational stores on our platform, GoFeast is available and serving in <strong>26 States</strong> in the USA. With these stores in <strong>Q1</strong> alone we have processed <strong>1,428 orders</strong> and have generated a <strong>gross volume of $157,307.</strong></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In this reporting duration we have not limited ourselves to Specialty Meat stores only and have added many Halal and Kosher restaurants as well primarily in our home location of New Jersey. Marketing efforts to promote these restaurants are yet to trigger for specialty restaurants and we are hopeful to see some results and get better analytics in coming quarters.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Besides rising specialty meat prices, marketing and promotions is still one of our most significant challenges and we are working hard to find innovative ways to market and promote GoFeast and to spread the word out across communities and regions. With a continued push for rapid expansion to reach our goal of 2,000 stores on our platform, in parallel our efforts will be concentrated for a cost-effective marketing and promotion strategy.  </p>

                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">Listing on CEX: </h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">To reiterate our commitment, listing on a Tier 1 exchange is a priority and an integral part of our long-term plan and success. We understand that the community want this sooner but as a genuine project already in operations and with a real-life blockchain use-case, we still need to abide by the policies and dynamics dictating the current crypto exchange listing landscape. From the GoFeast management team, we can assure that incredible efforts have been made and no stone left unturned to fulfill this quest sooner than later. In this quarter, we were successful to find right connections and meet representatives of some Tier 1 Exchanges and pitch GoFeast to them. While the listing / integration fees have been raised exorbitantly in recent months by some Tier 1 Exchanges but apart from fees and a thorough due diligence process, in the end it comes down to some key stats such as high volumes, number of wallets and a following by a larger community.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Even before our debut listing, our team has been working hard and has well executed the plan to convert our existing customer base into GOMT wallet holders along. One of the many aspects we had to address was to increase the number of current GOMT Wallets to well above 2,000 which we successfully achieved in this quarter. Our plan to expand our reach to increase our GOMT community will also kick start with our listing on BitMart.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are equally excited and are looking forward to upcoming GOMT BitMart debut listing and are confident enough to check off most of the boxes as required by any Tier 1 Exchange. We are putting our best efforts and energies for the highly anticipated GOMT launch on BitMart and have created a well thought out launch plan focused on not only generating enough positive traction but also to ensure stability in GOMT prices which we expect to swing significantly upon this listing. With a strong GOMT value proposition and trust in our execution capabilities as per our roadmap we have never been this confident in the long-term success of GoFeast. The listing on BitMart has been a bit delayed due to upgrade of their security protocols. Although the final date of listing is yet to be confirmed but the integration with Hydra Mainnet has already started. The exact listing date will be announced to our community first as soon as we get a confirmation from BitMart.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="h1 mb-4">GOMT Burn Status: </h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">At the start 2022 the GOMT monthly burn rate was increased to 4%. So far, 14,607 GOMT have been burnt in total, with 8,952.77 amounting for Q1, 2022 only. Following are the details for the monthly burn rate for first quarter of 2022:</p>
