                        <p>While many organizations are having trouble with supply chains, GoFeast continues to reliably deliver halal meats to consumers. Individuals order high-quality halal meats, on demand, using an intuitive smartphone app for same-day delivery.</p>

                          <p>“We know this pandemic is a difficult time for everyone. So, we decided to ramp up the number of delivery drivers and expand our hours of operation to ensure a consistent supply of quality halal meats for our customers.”</p>

                          <p>“We used to have to take phone orders in the store, which were time- consuming and inconvenient. Now, the app sends us the order, and even the payment process is integrated.”</p>

                        <p>Halal meat is rapidly gaining popularity across the USA because of the nutritional value as a healthy diet choice.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote class="fs-lg my-8">
                          <p>“Since halal meat is somewhat of a niche market in most states, local suppliers are the heroes in this supply chain. They are the ones helping us to make sure the halal meat supply remains uninterrupted for our customers. All this is possible after significant discussions with our business partners who rely heavily on local farms in each area for the supply of their meat products.”</p>
